#     -- we\'re not just about data


The goal of the Data Analytics Center (DAC) is to help researchers use the **Universityâ€™s most powerful and sophisticated computing resources** in a cost-efficient manner. 

Many members of our team of research computing scientists hold advanced degrees in the sciences and engineering.  We begin by **listening to you and determining your computational needs**.

Sometimes that means referring you to one of our partner organizations on Grounds that specialize in data analytics; other times it means embedding a DAC staff member in your lab for a fractional effort and pre-determined length of time, saving you the expense and hassle of hiring a full-time employee.
